# R2D2 - A music bot you can trust
The official R2D2 bot website and source code. If you want, make pull requests to make edits, and we can work on the bot together :)

# What does this bot have to do with JS?
This bot was made with javascript, and it's the best one I have ever made. I just wanted to upload the code so people can fork it and make it better (but no stealing ðŸ˜­). Also I am working on a website for it, so you better stay tuned!

# Why did I put this bot's code on GitHub?
Things are still being worked on, and as a solo developer, I need help sometimes. \
\
If you just make a pull request, tell me the things you added or edited, and I will test the code to see if it works on a seperate bot account (to make sure nothing bad happens) and if it works, and if I like it, I may add it to the bot.

# More FAQ are coming soon, too focused on making the website for R2D2
